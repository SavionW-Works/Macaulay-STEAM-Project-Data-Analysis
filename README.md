__NOTE:__ The HTML document in this repo was exported directly from Jupyter Notebook, therefore, the HTML precentage presented by Github does __NOT__  accurately represent where most of my programming skill went. *__All of the original code was made in Python.__* <br /> 
The spreadsheet with our data is also included in this repo. <br /> 

Description of Macaulay STEAM Festival (from macaulay.cuny.edu): <br /> 
*Macaulay STEAM Festival celebrates critical inquiry in the arts and sciences, with informal presentations tied to final semester projects for Arts in New York City (first year students), and Science Forward (sophomores).* <br />

*Students reflect on the similarities and differences between the types of critical inquiry that each seminar demands. For many, this will be one of their first opportunities to share work publicly, and may even mark the beginning of a lifelong calling!* <br />

I was part of a group of five that created and performed an experiment meant to measure how consumer electronics might operate under extreme conditions created by __climate change__. <br /> 

Over the course of about 2 weeks I...  <br /> 
- Helped plan and gather supplies for the experiment 
- Helped conduct our experiment in-person inside our college lounge 
- Created original __Python__ code to analyze a .csv file with a 600+ dimension using:  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Numpy and Pandas packages 
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
- Helped create a poster presentation and research paper for the experiment 
- Created clear and concise graphs from Python code to put on our poster and research paper
